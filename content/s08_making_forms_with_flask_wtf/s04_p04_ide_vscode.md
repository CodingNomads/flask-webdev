To install any of these suggested extensions, look for the extensions icon:

There's also a file auto save feature in VSCode's settings. To toggle it, head to `File -> Preferences -> Settings...` and search for "Files: Auto Save". For normal users who want to save their files manually every once in a while, then this feature is not recommended.
