Database Management
===================

What's a model? A model is basically [I need a way to describe this...]. The models are the objects that your webapp interacts with to get the data it needs and update data as needed. If say a user logs in , the webapp will need to load the information on the user so that the user sees nothing but what they expeect for the app.

If they register a new account, that means you'll add that information to the database. There are lots of other info that needs to be tracked with that user. The great thing about relational databases is that **relationships** can be formed between the data. Each user will have a *role* in the application, and that relationship between role and user can be defined with [].
