We will now take a look at an app that Ragtime is based on, called Microblog. While you will get to see all the cool features written into this app, you *won't* need to know how everything works in order to succeed in this course. Microblog is written entirely with Flask and a handful of extensions, and has many features you would expect in a current-day web app, including:

- Storing users and content in a database
- Attractive styling of the webpages
- Email delivery and verification
- User authentication and registration
- User permissions and roles
- Creating and editing blog posts and profiles
- Users can follow other users
- Provides an Application Programming Interface (API)

You can access a "production" version of the Microblog hosted on Heroku <a href="https://flask-microblog.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Go ahead and try it out, you'll see that while small, it is capable of quite a lot. Create an account, then login and make a post; say anything you want! Then come back and let's take a peek at the source code.
