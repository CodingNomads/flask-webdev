User Roles
==========

intro
-----

Sometimes an app with users might have only one "role" for every user (use the site the same exact way! Kinda boring right?). Some apps might have just two roles, perhaps a regular ol' user who can do a select few things in a webapp, and an administrator who can manage content and resources created by users or the admins themselves (`is_admin` in user model). But often there are *roles* with *permissions* that are in between regular user and admin such as moderators, who might have powers similar to admin but more limited. The virtual sky is the limit, as long as it can be coded.

~~Even some other times, permissions depend on *what page* a user visits. That will be true in our web app! And you'll see how to handle that [if that's even worth going into detail here]~~
