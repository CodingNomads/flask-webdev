Deployment Can Be Hard

You've learned a ton about Flask, way to go! :) Now you want to be able to show off your hard work and put your webapp on the internet. For that you will need to learn about **deployment**. And as you might have already gleaned from the title: _Deployment can be hard_.

But that's okay, and of course it's manageable and gets easier with training. Coming up, you'll walk through two different deployment options, and you will get a good overview of what options are out there. After that it comes again down to: _Training, training, training_.

Keep going even if something doesn't work quite right the first time. When deploying your webapp, there are many different cogwheels that need to fit together _just right_ for everything to function. Remember: the internet is a mess and you're about to leave your safe, local development environment in order to venture out into the world wild web. Out here, we're all greenhorns forever, but with practice you'll get better at being a greenhorn. :)

So let's get started. Ready... set... DEPLOY!
