So you've come this far. Why all this talk about "production" servers? Why should you not simply stick with using `flask run` also in production? It seems to have worked fine for you so far!

Hang on a second, haven't you seen the warnings in your console whenever you've launched your app?

>```
>WARNING: This is a development server.
>Do not use it in a production deployment.
>Use a production WSGI server instead
>
>* Restarting with stat
>* Debugger is active!
>* Debugger PIN: 123-456-789
>* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Flask's Development server is just that: a lightweight _development_ server. As the warning suggests: Leave handling the difficult decisions regarding serving stuff over the web to the professionals in that area, such as Nginx.

Throughout this module you will get to know a couple of different solutions for serving your Flask app in production in a safe and stable way. Let's next hear from a great PyCon talk What Is Deployment Anyway to get you grounded on what's up next in this section.
