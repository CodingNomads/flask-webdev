Let's start by discussing what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" target="_blank">Web Server</a> is and why you need to start thinking about them now. The Wikipedia article offers two options on what "web server" refers to:

- **Server Software** or
- **Hardware** dedicated to running this software

Let's explain each of those in a little more detail.

### Web Server Hardware

Server _hardware_ relates to a physical computer that is set up somewhere in the world and connected to a _network_. While this could be any network, what people usually mean when they talk about web servers as computers, are those connected to the _internet_. While you could set up a computer at your home as a web server, they are usually located in large server farms these days.

It helps, however, to keep in mind that these are nothing but specialized computers and that even your laptop could be used as web server hardware and do what they do. Only much less efficiently. To get your app accessible via the internet, you will need to run it on a web server that is _always on_, so that users can access it at any time.

### Web Server Software

Web servers are software that is specifically designed to efficiently handle web requests, which usually arrive as HTTP requests.

    <strong>Info:</strong> When you will read about a "web server" moving in forward in this course, it will refer to web server <em>software</em> rather than the physical machines.

A web _server_ differs from a web _framework_, such as Flask, although some may say that the line is blurry. Let's look at the difference and define how the terms are used in this course:

- **Web Server**: A web server listens for web connections and either serves static content from files, or passes requests onto other code.
- **Web Framework**: A web framework gives you scaffolding for writing your own custom code in such a way that it can be called via the Web. Most frameworks handle common details such as HTTP header parsing, URL routing, templating, database interactions via an ORM, etc.

For practical reasons you can think about the difference in your context as that you are _writing custom code_ in your web framework to build your app, but you will only need to _define some settings_ for your webserver to handle your app's communication with the rest of the internet.

Some popular web servers are:

- Apache
- Nginx
- Gunicorn

In this section, you will learn to interact with `nginx` and `gunicorn`. Apache is another common web server that could be used for the same objective that you'll be using Nginx for.

You learned that while you've been using Flask to develop your apps, you will _also_ need to run a web server to serve it on the internet. How will these two programs communicate with each other? Let's find out on the next page.
