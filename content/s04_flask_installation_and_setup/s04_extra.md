Alright, future Flask black belt. The first thing you'll want to do to begin your training is to make a Github repository for your project. If you don't already have a Github account, <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank">click here to make a free account.</a>

Once you're all set up with Github and are logged in, click the + icon in the top right corner and then click "New Repository."

[//]: # (I'll probably change the name from Ragtime to something that sounds more "code-y")

Now you'll have to give the new repository a name. For this project, just name it `flask-webdev`. Leave the description blank for now, keep "public" selected, and finally, leave "Initialize this repository with a README" unchecked.

Click "Create Repository". After that, you'll see something similar to the this:

![New Repository](../images/github_repo.png)


----------

This is where your local git repository will live and your primary place for development. To get started with a repository right away, go ahead and type

```git init ragtime```

The web app you'll make is called Ragtime, which is music social networking site. Once you do that [do other git stuff to put it on Github]
