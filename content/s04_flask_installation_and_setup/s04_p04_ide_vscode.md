What's free, open-source, and is priceless? Give up? It's a good ol' free *Integrated Development Environment*. The one we'll be using for this course is **VSCode**. You can download from the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">VSCode homepage</a>.

Setup should be pretty straightforward. Before you get started with development, consider installing these extensions to aid in your Flask web app development quest:

- <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wholroyd.jinja" target="_blank">Jinja</a> - Jinja template language support for Visual Studio Code
- <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WyattFerguson.jinja2-snippet-kit" target="_blank">Jinja2 Snippet Kit</a> - Jinja2 snippets for cool attractive people to use in your HTML templates.
-  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python" target="_blank">Python</a> - Linting, Debugging (multi-threaded, remote), Intellisense, Jupyter Notebooks, code formatting, refactoring, unit tests, snippets, and more.
- <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shardulm94.trailing-spaces" target="_blank">Trailing Spaces</a> - Highlight trailing spaces and delete them in a flash!
- <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NathanRidley.autotrim" target="_blank">AutoTrim</a> - Automatically trims trailing whitespace when moving the cursor from one line to another

[//]: # (Some more suggestions?)

To install suggestions, look for the extensions icon:

Then, once you've got VSCode running, you can go to `File -> Open Folder`, then navigate to your `flask-webdev` repository and open it up! In the next section, you'll add some code to accompany your lonely `README.md` file.
