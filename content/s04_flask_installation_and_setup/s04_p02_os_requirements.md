The operating system you will see in use throughout this course is Ubuntu, based on Linux. Ubuntu is a **UNIX-based** system, just like all **Linux** distributions. Mac OS is also UNIX-based.

<div class='alert alert-info' role='alert'>
    <strong>Info:</strong> It is common to develop and run web applications on UNIX-based systems. This is why you will find many online tutorials focusing on UNIX command-line instructions and tools
</div>

To work through this course you should use a UNIX-based operating system. This means that if you are using:

- **Ubuntu**: You should be able to follow along 1:1 with the tutorials in this course
- **Other Linux Distribution or Mac OS**: Most of the tutorials should be directly applicable. There might be some small differences that the course will attempt to point out where they occur
- **Windows**: You should install and work with WSL, the **Windows Subsystem for Linux**. This will natively install Linux on your computer and allow you to work on a UNIX system, alongside your Windows OS
  - Alternatively, our course team recommends using <a href="https://cmder.net/" target="_blank">*Cmder*</a>, which emulates a UNIX-based console

If you are on Windows, please make sure you install the <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> or <strong>Cmder</strong> your computer, and use it throughout this course. Below are some helpful links for setting up WSL.</div>
