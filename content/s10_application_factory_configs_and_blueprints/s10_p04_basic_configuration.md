Basic Configuration
------------
now you introduce the config class. Or should you say classes. Flask allows us to load a configuration as a class, which means you can create a class and define CONSTANTS within it to pass our settings to the app. you can even put multiple configuration classes inside a file and use a dictionary to "name" each one. In our case These names are actually values you define in our factory, which you'll see later (that last sentence might not be quite right)

you'll define more configurations later.
