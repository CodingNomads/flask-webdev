While Flask is a very popular microframework, it actually started out as an [April Fool's joke](https://web.archive.org/web/20110904053655/http://denied.immersedcode.org/). Armin Ronacher actually took that joke as a challenge and so began a journey that has made Flask what it is today. It's become so popular, in fact, that it's been used by websites such as:

- <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> uses Flask to power their API
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> has used Flask for their internal stack
- <a href="https://www.twilio.com/" target="_blank">Twilio</a> for their public and private API
- Heck, even former US President Obama's campaign team used it for his 2012 campaign website

So why would these websites, or really any website, want to use Flask? As was discussed in the previous page, Flask is a microframework, and microframeworks are simple but powerful. With Flask, you can get a basic website up and running *right away*, all within a single Python script. If you want to expand its capabilities and you're picky (or not) about what technologies you want to use, that's no problem either because Flask does not make *any* decisions for you. If you want to use a relational database for your underlying website data, you can choose any kind, or even if you want a NoSQL database like MongoDB, that's fine, too! It doesn't just stop at databases, either.

You might be thinking, "I thought you said Flask and microframeworks could only do one thing!" And you would be correct. While Flask doesn't do anything else but provide a basic server, there are oodles and oodles of open-source Flask extensions that can probably get most if not all of the functionality you might want in your application. We'll go over a few of them in this course.

Now that you have an idea what Flask is at a high level, let's talk more about what you should expect from this course.
