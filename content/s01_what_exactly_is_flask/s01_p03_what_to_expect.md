In this course, you will be programming in Python to build an app using the Flask Web Application framework. Specifically, you'll build a music sharing social networking app from start to finish.

You'll need to feel comfortable with the Python language, and the course assumes you have some knowledge and experience of packages, modules, functions, decorators, and object oriented programming in general. However, you won't need any knowledge about Flask to be able to learn the material in this course.

You should also feel comfortable using the command line of your operating system, as you will be using the command line quite a bit throughout this course. In particular, you'll use the command line interface (CLI) to configure your environment, test code, and push your project to version control. You'll be using Github to store and update your project as you build it from the ground up, so some familiarity with git is nice to have.

I'm sure you're excited to dive in, but before you do, in the next section you'll see just what a simple Flask application can do!
