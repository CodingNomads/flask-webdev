In this course, you will be programming in Python to build apps using the Flask Web Application framework. You'll need to feel comfortable with the Python language, and the course assumes you have some knowledge and experience of packages, modules, functions, decorators, and object oriented programming in general, but you won't need any knowledge about Flask to be able to learn the material in this course.

You should also feel comfortable with using the command line of your operating system, as you will be using the command line quite a bit throughout this course.

You'll build a music sharing social networking app from start to finish. We'll be using git as our version control system.
