###### What knowledge / prerequisites are required to take this course? Be specific.

I have this already written in the course content:

"You'll need to feel comfortable with the Python language, and the course assumes you have some knowledge and experience of packages, modules, functions, decorators, and object oriented programming in general. However, you won't need any knowledge about Flask to be able to learn the material in this course.

"You should also feel comfortable using the command line of your operating system, as you will be using the command line quite a bit throughout this course. In particular, you'll use the command line interface (CLI) to configure your environment, test code, and push your project to version control. You'll be using Github to store and update your project as you build it from the ground up, so some familiarity with git is nice to have."

###### How many short labs/challenges will students complete in this course?

15

###### How many larger projects will students complete in this course?

###### Describe the project(s) that students will build in this course. The more detail the better.

Wanted to expand on my answers to the above questions.

"How many short labs/challenges will students complete in this course?"

This number is still being determined. There will be several small challenges in the course platform itself to let students practice what they learned in each section. Some of the challenges will be required to complete in order to progress through the course, but use knowledge they will have already learned. I'm estimating there will be around 15 shorter challenges within the course platform. Later, there may be 15 or so more as part of labs.

"How many larger projects will students complete in this course?"

Students will complete one large project as part of the course. They'll be led from start to finish in how to create a social media app.

Students will also create a project of their own for their capstone project, or possibly extend the social media app in significant ways. Other project ideas are: create a forum webapp on a general topic of student's choice, or create a webapp for an online store.

Now to describe the project in more detail:

The first project students will build is from the course itself. The reason for this is because much of the course material builds on itself. It doesn't make sense for students to learn about one topic individually as most topics require a working app in order to experiment with. This is a social media app for sharing music that will involve storing information in a database, authentication, building forms, creating templates for the app content, and defining the behavior of the webapp as a whole.

Most of the sections will have a few "assignments" or mini-projects where students will apply what they learned in previous lessons and sections in order to build something in order to progress. An example: a students is taught how to make and render a form on a webpage, and later learns about password security. The assignment shortly after the password security lesson is to build a login form and use it in the app they are making. This doesn't require any extra knowledge outside what they've already been presented with, and plenty of hints will be given so they can progress soon enough.

The last project will be a project of their choosing that will apply most if not all of the knowledge they gained while building the first project. This could be a similar project to the social media app such as an online forum, or could be much different but still doable such as an online store.

###### Who will benefit from taking this course? Not everyone is cut out for / interested in this course, so we want to know, Who NEEDS this course? Where do they work? Where do they want to work? What skills do they have? What desires do they have? Be as specific as possible.

Gist:

This course is for those who want to grow their skill set with different web frameworks, build on their basic knowledge of Flask, or who want to work in web development as a career. It is also appropriate for those who are both experienced in Python and familiar with the basics of building websites like HTML and CSS.

It is perfect for an intermediate Python developer who wants dive into the world of web development. Flask is one of the easiest web development frameworks to get started with as it is programmed in one of the world's most popular languages. As long as a student motivated to learn web development has already learned the fundamentals of Python, even with elementary knowledge of HTML, he or she can succeed in this course.

Who NEEDS this course?

- Those who know Python but are perhaps intimidated by the vast world of web development; to create one's first webapp with Flask, you only need *one* file and just a few lines of code.
- Seasoned web developers who know their way around using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and/or PHP, but are curious about making websites using the very popular Python language. By completing this course, they will demonstrate to employers that they understand more than one way to make a website, and are more well-rounded in the subject of web development.

Where do they work?

Because web development jobs are exploding, these people can work pretty much anywhere and still look attractive to tech employers by completing this course. However, people who want to take this course are more likely to work in the tech industry already; perhaps they are engineers in another technical discipline.

Where do they want to work?

There are many well-known companies that use Flask in their web stack. Examples are: Twilio, Lyft, Patreon, Pinterest. These companies are mostly web services companies, but not every company one might be interested in working for is strictly a consumer-facing business. Often other companies like engineering services  have a need for skills like Flask.

###### What specific problems / failures are people currently facing, which our course will solve? How are their wants, needs, hopes, dreams, and desires not currently being met, and therefore driving them to educate themselves? Feel free to go deep into our customer psyche here and list all possibilities!

Sometimes learning something in programming is ineffective, where this language, that framework, or the "best" tutorial just doesn't cut it; it happens. In cases where trying to learn about web development falls short because JavaScript and CSS is confusing or the setup to learn isn't convenient, this course can be a sigh of relief. Python has been known as one of the easiest languages to learn, is great for teaching beginners to learn programming, and is super popular. Combine that with Flask's "hit the ground running" capability and you have a winning combo. One can finally learn how to make a website from scratch and simultaneously improve in a well-sought-after programming language.

There are a lot of details when it comes to webapps and the technology around them, but Flask distills most of that down to a relative handful of Python function calls and operations. The extensions built for Flask integrate with existing industry-standard technologies like relational databases/SQL and Bootstrap to make building a professional look-and-feel website much easier.

###### What failure(s) might happen if they donâ€™t take our course? I.e. What will it cost to NOT take our course?

We already know web development is hot, and jobs in this area won't be going away anytime soon. Flask is one of the most popular Python web frameworks in existence. It grows even more popular by the day as more and more companies embrace it. To not learn Flask may cost a developer a killer job at a killer company, which could even mean thousands of dollars in lost salary. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will get you a job in web development. However, taking the next step toward modern web development techniques will better guarantee a developer in this space can succeed and keep up with the times.

###### By the end of this course, what specific things will students be able to do?

Students will be able to:

- Gain understanding in how the web works
- Write complete web applications using Python and Flask
- Create impressive web forms and accept user input
- Use relational databases and Flask-SQLAlchemy to create custom tables, add and remove data, and run specific queries
- Utilize the built-in Jinja2 template engine and Bootstrap to construct polished templates
- Understand the difference between GET and POST requests
- Manage user logins and authentication, protect sensitive information like passwords, and handle user sessions
- Send user verification emails automatically and set up email application alerts
- Gracefully handle and report errors
- Implement and test custom Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
- Deploy their application on Heroku
- Write basic unit tests with pytest
- Use VSCode to build all kinds of coding projects not limited to Flask

###### What are the financial / career opportunities for taking this course?

If my answers above don't answer that question, I'm happy to expand. :) See "Who will benefit from taking this course?" and "What failure(s) might happen if they donâ€™t take our course?"

###### Why should someone buy THIS course as opposed to others available? What sets us apart? Why is our course superior to other similar courses?

While this course is an intro to Flask, it also introduces an important concept called unit testing. Unit testing and development operations, or dev ops, in general is becoming more and more a standard business practice as companies seek to improve their workflow. Companies are even hiring people for dev ops alone, so we think it's important that students get a taste of what unit testing means. Unit testing is just one piece of dev ops, but it ensures that code is working as expected. Certain unit testing frameworks can make complex code easy to test with reusable chunks of code like fixtures. This course gives you an introduction into how unit testing works and how it can save you time debugging. The course will provide examples of unit tests using pytest and will even guide you through setting up your own testing environment.

Another reason this course is for YOU is if you can't stand working in JavaScript or CSS. With knowledge of just Python and HTML, two of the easiest languages to learn, you can write full working web apps without knowing or touching CSS or JavaScript. Flask is great for the novice or experienced web developer, and any web developer who is tired of working in JS or CSS but curious about Python will get a lot of use out of this course.

Are you bored from all "professional" tutorials that take you through the material with little or no personality? While it's important that a course like this teach you what you need to know and be matter-of-fact, learning should be fun, right? This course is different in that mixed in with all the im-bore-tant details are witty jokes, puns, a few strange but relevant examples, and just a little bit of sass to keep you entertained. We'd be surprised if you can make it through the course without a snicker or almost spitting your coffee onto the screen.

You could buy a course on another website with tons of in-depth videos and exercises, but what if you get stuck and no amount of searching can get you unstuck? In that case, it's helpful to have someone to ask. Like most of our courses, this CodingNomads course is no different. By purchasing, you automatically unlock a community of fellow learners and mentors in our online forum, for life (right?). You can even opt to have your own experienced, professional mentor guide you through the course with scheduled face-to-face video sessions. Feel free to take the course and get help in your pajamas!

This course will give you more a ways than just one. While the videos do go over the material, you also have access to written information about the subject at hand. Then once you've got a basic understanding, we give you plenty of exercises to test your knowledge and drill the information into your head.

###### How much do you think we should sell this course for? How much do you think an average person would reasonably pay for this course? (This is always a tough question. We're just curious about your thoughts.)

I think no less than $50, but $75 to $100 seems reasonable. Since web development is a valuable skill or set of skills, the price is low enough to be a good deal but high enough to give an expectation of quality.

###### What would hold a student back from buying this course? What objections might they have?

There are a ton of web frameworks out there like React and Angular, so which framework a student might think is most valuable to learn is definitely up for debate. A potential student's background, knowledge, or opinions on which skills are more marketable may hold them back from buying a course on Flask web development. Even if they are experienced in Python and want to learn a web framework or web development in general, they may opt for a course on Django (luckily we have a course for that).

They may object to taking a course on a framework that is not quite as popular as Django. A course on Flask also may not cover all the skills they want to learn, or it may not cover a particular technology as in-depth as they would want.

They may even think learning web development is not worth the time!

###### How does our product solve those objections?

I'm not totally sure what is meant by this question but here goes.

What sets Flask apart from others is that it's easy to get started with and doesn't need a lot of configuration. It's also very flexible when it comes to which technologies can be built around it.

While the student would have to first buy the course or another course to access, the forum might give some insight into what technologies and skills are relevant vs. not.

Using Flask does not limit one to only using Flask as a web framework! Flask can also integrate with other frameworks such as Angular (as an example: https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-integrating-flask-and-angularjs/). Learning Flask only adds to one's web dev toolbelt, it doesn't mean a developer has to "pick one" to stick with.

###### Are you available to mentor for this program? (After the beta portion.)
Yes <--
No

###### If you are available to mentor for this course, how many hours a week would you be available to mentor over the coming months?
Up to 5 for Flask, up to 10 total over all courses.

###### Can you recommend any other potential mentors for this course?
Possibly Gilad or Martin, but I can't speak for them. Martin is only somewhat familiar with Flask as far as I know. I may know someone who is interested. I may know someone else who could mentor, but not sure of his interest in tutoring.

###### Are you available to take phone inquiries about the course for prospective students? (At least in the beginning while we ramp up on it. We'll plan to join these calls to learn from you as you discuss the course with a potential student, so we can train our sales team to take these calls.)
Yes <--
No

###### Do you have any other info, images, videos, material, collateral, quotes, inspirations or anything else you could share with us to help us market this course?

Not yet, but if I find something I'll let you know!
