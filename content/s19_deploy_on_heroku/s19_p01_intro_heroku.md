As an example for a PaaS (= Platform as a Service), you are going to get familiar with <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>. But first let's start out with this general term:

### PaaS - Platform as a Service

Let's hear it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service" target="_blank">from Wikipedia</a> for a concise blurb:

>Platform as a service (PaaS) or application platform as a service (aPaaS) or platform-based service is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.

As you might already know, deployment and server maintenance can be hard and a lot of work. On top of that, this work doesn't really have much to do with application and web development, so it might not be what you're interested in pursuing.

Companies such as Heroku took it onto themselves to develop easily maintainable platforms that allow you to minimize the effort necessary to get your webapp running on the internet.

### Heroku

Heroku is a PaaS that has been around for quite a while and provides a stable and user-friendly experience. They have tons of experience and created an powerful and intuitive platform that takes a load of deployment worries off your shoulders, which is ideal when you just want to get your project out into the world-wide-world.

Since a PaaS does work you would have to do otherwise, these platforms usually charge money for their services. However, Heroku has a <a href="https://www.heroku.com/pricing" target="_blank">Free and Hobby Tier</a> that allows you to run a few personal projects free of charge. That's what you'll be working with in this course section.

Before being ready to deploy your app, you will need to revisit a few sections in your code and clean it up for production. Heroku also requires some specific settings that make it possible to launch your app on their platform. Let's get to it so you can finally let your friends and family discover your work through the internet.
