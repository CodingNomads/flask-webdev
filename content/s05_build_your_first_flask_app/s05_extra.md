Hello web world:
    Try making more routes
    Try putting some html in (headers, links...)
    what if you return a number

As a quick aside, you can think of a handler as a financial advisor,

maybe a kitchen worker, because there are all sorts of tasks going on (dishwashing, take order, cook order, ...)
