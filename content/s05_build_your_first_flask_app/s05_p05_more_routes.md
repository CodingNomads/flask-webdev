Alright Flask cadets, it's time for your first mission. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to define three routes in your Flask application.

The first route shall be for an "about" page that was shown in the last page, but this time, write a blurb about either
- what you hope to get out of this course, or
- a mini bio of yourself.

The second route shall be for a page that lists your favorite songs. Use some HTML to make it look somewhat pretty!

The third route shall be for a page that has a link to the two other pages setforth above.
