Alright Flask cadet, it's time for your first mission. Your mission is to define three routes in your Flask application.

The first route shall be for an "about" page that was shown in the last lesson, but this time, write a blurb about either
- what you hope to get out of this course, or
- a mini bio of yourself.

The second route shall be for a page that lists your favorite songs. Use some HTML to make it look somewhat pretty! Try using some `<li>`, `<strong>`, or `<em>` tags and a sprinkle of header tags like `<h3>` to add some excitement.

The third route shall be for a page that has a link to the two other pages set forth above.

If you haven't already, now's a good time to make your first `git commit`!
