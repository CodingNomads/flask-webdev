"Email: the way of the future!" -1980's
"Spam. Spam. Spam. Oh, cool, it's from Hobby Lobby!" -Nowish

While email was invented decades ago, it's still around...

The technology behind most email delivery and receiving is called Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). To make your life simple, you don't have to get too technical to send emails via your app because Flask-Mail is an extension that does most of the work for you.

To install it, yet another simple pip command:

```bash
(env) $ pip install flask-mail
```

All you need for email support is two main things:

1. An SMTP server
2. Settings configured for that server

As for 1., you could host one yourself, but for development, it's much easier to use an external server. In the next lesson, you'll be guided through the steps to setup a Google Gmail account so you can start playing around with emails right away.
The settings you'll learn about in the lesson after that, but let's get you set up with a secondary email account!
