A part of every good project is a good `README` file where you describe what your project is about. Before sharing your project with other people, as well as showing it to potential employers, you should always include a good description.

Here is a great website that has a concise overview of all you need to know about making READMEs:

If you want to dive deeper, there is an entertaining course dedicated to writing README files freely available on Udacity. This is purely optional, but it might be a fun break:

Once you've finished writing a README file for your capstone project, you are ready to submit it for review by your mentor, or post a link on <a href="https://forum.codingnomads.co/" target="_blank">our forum</a>.
