What project should you build as your capstone? **Choose your own adventure!**

The _best idea_ for building your capstone project is _your idea_. Choose a project that you personally want to build. You might have a website idea floating around your brain for a long time. This is the best time to start working on it! Or maybe there's a task you would like to automate, some habit you want to make part of your daily life? Can you build a webapp around that idea?

Choosing a project that you are **personally interested in** will make sticking with your project much easier, also when it gets daunting. It will also help to drive you to keep exploring and learn new and additional aspects of Flask, simply because you will need this or that to make your project work the way you envision it.

    <strong>Tl;dr:</strong> If you have an idea for a webapp, make that your capstone project

Before you dive too deep into a too complex project, however, ask yourself what would be the **minimum viable product** of your project idea. Give it some time to think it through. What's the _main_ functionality, how could you build that in the _easiest_ way? Start there. Once you finished the minimal version, you can always keep building on it to make it more awesome.

### Other Options

If you don't yet have an idea for a project you would want to work on, here are a couple of ideas for your inspiration:

- **Portfolio Site**: Build a Portfolio app that you can use to display all the projects you built in this course, as well as contact information, integrate your GitHub portfolio via their AOI, etc.
- **Future-Job Projects**: Look at Job Postings of companies that you are interested to work for, and figure out what projects they are working on. Build something that could help them
- **Clones**: Build a clone of your favorite site on the web. Maybe you love Twitter? Build a Twitter clone! Etc.
