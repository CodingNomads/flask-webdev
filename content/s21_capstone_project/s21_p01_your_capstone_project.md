You made it to the capstone section! Awesome work and congratulations! If you went over all the course modules and completed all labs, you already have a solid portfolio of Flask projects under your belt. Now it's time for your *best Flask project thus far*.

### What's A Capstone Project?

Your capstone project will be a new Flask project of your *own choosing* that you will build from scratch. Your capstone project won't follow a tutorial.

### Why Build A Capstone Project?

Since you won't be following a tutorial, you *will* need to synthesize your knowledge and learning from the course and cast it into a new form. This helps to solidify and anchor the concepts you learned and practiced. Working on your capstone project will also very likely send you off on a couple of personal learning quests that are individual to your project, which is great training for any real-life development scenario. You will need to _plan_, _research_ and _resolve issues_ that are unique to your specific project. Your capstone will be a challenging task that is extremely rewarding and an awesome learning experience.

### Halp?!

Don't worry, you got this! By working through this course up to now, you have gained a _ton_ of skills in Flask web development, spanning all the way from building a project through deploying it on the web.

If you are working through this course with a mentor, of course you have your mentor as a resource. Bounce ideas off your mentor, ask about feasibility, and make sure to keep them up-to-date with your code and progress. Clearly define the challenges you get hung up on and how you've tried to solve them. This will make it much easier for them to help you on your way.

If you are working on this course without a mentor, the same still holds true. Make sure you _understand your challenge_ and know <a href="https://forum.codingnomads.co/t/how-to-ask-a-question/30" target="_blank">how to formulate it well</a>. Describe your situation in detail, and describe how you've tried to solve it. Then head over to our forum and <a href="https://forum.codingnomads.co/c/courses/flask-webdev/33" target="_blank">post a question to your community</a> there.

Your capstone project will (and should) be a challenge for you, but you've got the skills and the grit to work through it. Choose a project idea that you are _genuinely interested in_ and it'll make sticking with it much easier. Alright, time to go and start building your capstone project to put a glowing crown on top of your Flask projects!
